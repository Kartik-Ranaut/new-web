                    <p>
                        The workshop’s objective was to help students see their innate potential to live a stable life.
                        The workshop was based on intense exploration where students asked about their daily life
                        issues. The facilitators helped them see the root cause of problems and its solution rather than
                        giving any readymade solution.

                        The first day started with the topic’s introduction and some checkpoints to be maintained
                        throughout the workshop. Sir acquainted the explorers with the basic idea of consciousness and
                        relationships. He also told how the human mind tends to work logically and remains devoid of
                        feelings without the right understanding. Knowing the inherent potential and feelings leads to a
                        harmonious and fulfilling life.

                        The Sustainable Production Center (SPC) is a startup that was initiated by the Value Education (VE) Cell at AKGEC (Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College). The center is located at the back of the boy's hostel on the AKGEC campus, covering an area of approximately 27 feet by 18 feet. The center was conceptualized in January 2022, and after a few months of planning, it was finally registered with partnership deeds on July 1st, 2022, with a holistic approach in mind.
                        The primary objective of the VE Cell in establishing the SPC was to create an eco-friendly and people-friendly production center that not only helps reduce the excessive burden of non-renewable resources on nature but also enriches nature and benefits the local community. The center is committed to preparing products using local resources and labor, in a decentralized production system. The initial product line of the center includes handmade soaps made from Aloe Vera and Neem grown on the campus, with three different types available: Aloe Vera Soap, Aloe Vera Soap with Mogra Fragrance, and Neem Soap that works as a natural scrubber.
