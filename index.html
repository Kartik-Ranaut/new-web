                    To ensure an eco-friendly environment, healthy work culture and to develop a holistic worldview among faculty members, students, staff, and their family members as well as nearby areas, Value Education Cell (VE Cell) was established in AKGEC during the year 2017 under the guidelines of AKTU with the following objectives:
                    <div class="points">
                        <br>• Develop right understanding by sharing the   understanding of what to do (Value Education).
                        <br>• Develop right skills by teaching how to do (Technical Education).
                        <br>• Practice right living during the period of education and its continuity.
                        <br>• Living in relationship with other human beings leading to mutual happiness.
                        <br>• Living in relationships with rest-of-nature leading to mutual prosperity and hence ensuring an eco-friendly environment in the campus.

                    <h3>
                        A limited hours (within 10day duration) student workshop on the topic “Conscious Engineering” was planned by the VE Cell, AKGEC, 10th June 2023 onwards, under the amiable guidance of Dr Gopal Babu. The objective was to help the explorers see self, the conscious entity; and also the process of self-exploration. During the workshop, we aimed to accomplish the following objectives:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increase awareness levels</li>
                            <li>Develop the ability to counsel oneself</li>
                            <li>Improve the ability to sense our own and others' emotions
                            </li>
                            <li>Enhance skills to handle reactions, both internal and external
                            </li>
                            <li>Strengthen teamwork capabilities
                            </li>
                            <li>Learn to take breaks when necessary
                            </li>
                            <li>Improve listening skills
                            </li>
                            <li>Gain wisdom in distinguishing between right and wrong.
                            </li>
                        </ul>



The student workshop was split into multiple interactive sessions, encouraging attendees to ask questions, provide reflections, and actively participate throughout. Everyone was welcome to seek clarification and engage in meaningful discussions.

The steps covered in the workshop were as follows:

1. Be aware – Observe your imagination at this moment, i.e. the desire (feeling), thought, expectation. No Reaction! [MFC: Observation/Conclusion]
2. Is the feeling that you have at this moment naturally acceptable to you? [Feelings/Thoughts]
3. Are you in harmony, happy with the feeling that you have at this moment?
4. Who decided the feeling that you have at this moment? Did you decide it or someone else/situation outside decided it?
5. On what basis did you decide the feeling you have at this moment?
Did you decide it on the basis of understanding or on the basis of an assumption? [is the feeling based on my assumption/his behaviour or right understanding/reality]
6. a) Which feelings are naturally acceptable to you?
Feelings of relationship or opposition, harmony or disharmony, co-existence or struggle?
6. b) we explore within to understand relationship, harmony, and co-existence in its completeness, in the context of whole nature, existence.
7. a) Ensure that the feeling that you have at this moment is in line with the feeling of Relationship, Harmony and Co-existence and not otherwise. On this basis, I will be in a state of harmony and happiness at this moment.
7. b) when I am able to understand relationship, harmony and co-existence in its completeness, then, I will be able to decide my feeling, thought accordingly in a natural manner, and I will always be comfortable within, I will be in a state of harmony and happiness in continuity.

As part of an evaluation process, students were provided with a self-assessment form to gauge their comprehension levels. The form included four parameters: ‘awareness’, ‘ability to perceive one's own and others' needs, ‘ability to manage internal and external reactions’, and ‘ability to provide self-counseling’. Upon reviewing the completed forms, it was evident that many students showed improvement in these areas
